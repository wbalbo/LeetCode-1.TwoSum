# LeetCode-1.TwoSum - Difficulty: Easy

My solution for a problem in LeetCode called TwoSum, original link: 

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/" target="_blank">Here</a>

Problem: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Certainly has better and performatic ways to improve this code (using 2 for loops for example or using a HashMap) but I want to document my solutions
to see my improvements in this platform and in my algorithm's learning.

This is a problem part of Top Interview Questions lists, from Leetcode.
